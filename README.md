  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    1. Motivation: Motivated by the need for a more organized and fair resource allocation system,
        this project aims to develop a hardware-based digital circuit capable of assigning seats to indi-
        viduals based on priority levels. Traditional software-driven solutions often introduce latency
        or complexity in real-time scenarios. A digital hardware solution can offer faster, more reliable
        performance, ensuring that high-priority requests are handled with minimal delay.
    2. Problem Statement: In critical resource allocation environments like healthcare and trans-
        portation, managing waiting lists based on priority is essential. Conventional first-come, first-
        served methods neglect urgency, leading to inefficiencies. This project proposes a digital system
        for automated seat assignment that prioritizes requests, ensuring timely service and optimal
        resource utilization.
    3. Features:
      • Real-Time Priority Assignment: Assigns seats based on priority levels in real-time.
      • Hardware-Based Implementation: Utilizes digital circuits for efficient processing.
      • Dynamic Request Handling: Adapts to changing request priorities effectively.
      • Scalability and Adaptability: Designed to accommodate varying system demands.
