  <summary>Detail</summary>

  ### Motivation
  > Motivated by the need for a more organized and fair resource allocation system, this project aims to develop a hardware-based digital circuit capable of assigning seats to individuals based on priority levels. Traditional software-driven solutions often introduce latency or complexity in real-time scenarios. A digital hardware solution can offer faster, more reliable performance, ensuring that high-priority requests are handled with minimal delay.
  ### Problem Statement
  > In critical resource allocation environments like healthcare and transportation, managing waiting lists based on priority is essential. Conventional first-come, first-served methods neglect urgency, leading to inefficiencies. This project proposes a digital system for automated seat assignment that prioritizes requests, ensuring timely service and optimal resource utilization.
  ### Features
  > - **Real-Time Priority Assignment**: Assigns seats based on priority levels in real-time.
  > - **Hardware-Based Implementation**: Utilizes digital circuits for efficient processing.
  > - **Dynamic Request Handling**: Adapts to changing request priorities effectively.
  > - **Scalability and Adaptability**: Designed to accommodate varying system demands.
